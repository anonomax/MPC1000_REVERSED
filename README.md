running rthe dis asm.

Disassembler for SH3(or SH4) binary files.

To use it, just drag and drop your binary file to the SuperH disassembler executable. If there is no problem, it will create a file "output.txt" that contain 4 columns :
- The offset in hex
- The content of the byte
- The translation in Assembly language if it exists.
- When it's possible : the destination address of an instruction
